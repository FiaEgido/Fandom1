        The game take place in a decrepit,victorian gothic city called <span style="color: rgba(167, 24, 24, 0.534);"> "yharnam" ,</span>
         which is the home to <a href="https://bloodborne.fandom.com/wiki/The_Healing_Church"><span style="color: rgba(167, 24, 24, 0.534);">"healing church"</span></a>,

        The blood used by the healing
        church is unique and serves as a potent medical remedy capable of curing almost any ailment, from simple flesh
        wounds to virulent diseases.
        Over the years, many travellers journey to the city seeking the healing church sacred blood to cure there affliction;
        the player takes the role of one such traveller but one with another purpose in mind, for the player seeks something 
        mysterious and obscure, something unknown to most if not for a select few.<span style="color: rgba(167, 24, 24, 0.534);">"pale blood". </span>

         Upon awakening it will become evidently clear the city is plagued with an endemic illness that has transformed most of 
        its citizens into bestial  creatures, while the others hunt them incessantly. the player must then navigate the streets
        of yharnam and overcome its violently deranged inhabitants and horrifying monters in order to survive.

     Shortly, the player will enter a spectral realm called the <span style="color: rgba(167, 24, 24, 0.534);">Hunters's Dream,</span>which acts as both a sanctuary and a workshop

        <div class="container">
              
        <h2> Game mechanics </h2>
        <img src="workshop.jpg" alt="hunt" class="center" width="550px" heigh="500px">
        <p>  Bloodborne is a third-person action RPG. Just like the Souls games, the core mechanic of the game is that
          it uses <span style="color: rgba(196, 33, 33, 0.644);">death to teach players how to react in perilous environments, encouraging the use of trial and error
          in order to overcome its difficulty.</span> 
          By defeating enemies, the player will obtain<a target="blank" href="https://bloodborne.fandom.com/wiki/Blood_Echoes"> <b style="color: rgba(216, 41, 41, 0.767);">Blood Echoes</b></a> that can be used
          for levelling up, upgrading equipment, and buying supplies.The combat in Bloodborne is similar to the one present
          in the Souls games, although a few tweaks have been made to the formula. Bloodborne encourages the player to approach
          combat in a <span style="color: rgba(196, 33, 33, 0.644);">more "aggressive" way, instead of the "passive" style of combat</span>present in past games. This not only makes
          the combat much faster-paced, but also forces the player to rely less on defense in order to survive. <b>According to Miyazaki:
            "the enemies are strong and fierce, and if you wait passively to respond, you're going to be eaten and killed."</b></p>
                 
        <p>A few changes have been made to the controls: <b>By pressing L1,</b> <span  style="color: rgba(196, 33, 33, 0.644);">the player can transform their weapons (for example, the saw can
          transform into a large blade with longer range).</span>The healing items have been assigned to the Triangle button while other usable items,
           such as Molotov Cocktails are assigned to the Square button. With the Circle button, when the player is not locked to an enemy, the character
           will perform a roll like in past games. However, when the player is locked to an enemy, the character will do a dashing sidestep instead, which
           is a far faster and more agile move than the traditional roll. By holding the R2 button for some time and then releasing it the player will perform
           a powerful charged attack.</p>
                 
       <p>A new feature present in Bloodborne is the inclusion of <b style="color: rgba(196, 33, 33, 0.644);">firearms, </b>which have been introduced in order to fit with the Victorian setting 
           of the game and the new style of combat. Guns, however, are meant to stun enemies, not deal a huge amount of damage (although this is 
           slowly being called into question), and work better at close range. Shields will be largely absent from the game, forcing players to rely
           on their dodging abilities to avoid damage. <b style="color: rgba(196, 33, 33, 0.644);">Magic will have a minimal presence</b> presence in the game and it will be replaced by gadgets.
                 
           Bloodborne takes place in a large and <b style="color: rgba(196, 33, 33, 0.644);">continuous open world environment. </b>The world is interconnected like in Dark Souls, with some areas being
           available to explore from the beginning while others are unlocked as the player progresses throughout the story. Each area is connected to one
           or several other areas and players will be able to find and unlock shortcuts in each area which will ease navigation through the levels in case
           the player is killed. Although the game takes place mostly in the city of Yharnam, players will be able to visit several other locations and small
           villages on the outskirts of the city. The game will have a <b style="color: rgba(196, 33, 33, 0.644);">heavy focus on exploration</b> and sometimes it will be required to use a torch in order
           to navigate through pitch black areas.</p>
                 
       <p>During their quest in Yharnam, players will have to face <b style="color: rgba(197, 47, 47, 0.712);">nightmarish creatures, including demented townsfolk, lycanthropes, and giant crows among others.</b>
          The enemies in Bloodborne have an improved AI and will be able to wander and patrol several areas, even forming large mobs to hunt down the player.
          The demented citizens of Yharnam are able to talk to each other and create strategies to take down the player and the beasts alike. Along with the standard enemies,
          players will have to engage in battles against powerful bosses, another trademark of the Soul series. The game will also feature a day and night cycle, which will
          affect the behavior of enemies.
                 
          <b style="color: rgba(197, 47, 47, 0.712);"></b> <b style="color: rgba(197, 47, 47, 0.712);">Blood Vials</b> will be the healing items of Bloodborne, replacing the Estus Flasks from Dark Souls. By pressing Triangle the player
          will use a Blood Vial to recover health. Another way to recover health is through the regain system. After receiving an attack from an enemy, a yellowy orange-ish bar
          will appear in the player's health meter, representing the amount of health that can be recovered. If the player manages to counterattack before the bar runs out, the
          player will recover a portion of health for every hit they land on the enemy. This system encourages the player to be more offensive, but it is incredibly risky as well,
          since the players are opening themselves to other attacks by nearby enemies.</p>
                 
       <p> Bloodborne will also feature online mechanics. <b style="color: rgba(197, 47, 47, 0.712);">Players will be able to see the phantoms of other nearby players </b> of other nearby players and the Message and Bloodstain systems from the Souls games are back.
           However, the Bloodstain will be replaced by Gravestones, which will allow to see the phantom of another player seconds before their death, which can be used to the player's advantage
           to detect ambushes or other environmental hazards. Both the Message and the Gravestone system are carried out by the Messengers, demonic creatures who act as the player's servants.
           Bloodborne also features a co-op mode with up to three players, which can be triggered by ringing two bells: The Beckoning Bell, which summons hunters from other worlds, and the Small
           Resonant Bell, which allows a player to be summoned to other players' worlds. As opposed to the Souls games, where summoned players appeared as glowing phantoms, in Bloodborne the "summoned" players
           will have a small glow about them corresponding to their role (green-blue for a summon, crimson for an invader). Invasions can be triggered with the Sinister Resonant Bell (typical PvP levels are between 70-125).
           Alternatively, members of the Cainhurst Vilebloods and Executioners can sometimes ring the Beckoning Bell only to find themselves being invaded by a member of the opposing covenant. Invaders summoned through this
           method are referred to as having been "beckoned".</p>

       had a significant influence on his interests. <b style="color: rgba(192, 27, 27, 0.692);">His inability to comprehend the content of what he was reading only lent itself
        to his creativity;</b>his imagination filled in the blanks of what he couldn't understand in those books. This love of the fantastical
       ignited by authors <a target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Stoker"><span style="color: rgba(192, 27, 27, 0.692);">Bram Stoker</span></a>and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft">
        <span style="color: rgba(192, 27, 27, 0.692);">H.P. Lovecraft</span></a> even informed his decision to join the FromSoftware team, developing Demon's
       Souls and create the highly anticipated Elden Ring.
                
     Fast forward to 2012, and development on Bloodborne was in its preliminary stages. The team knew they wanted to create a world rife
     with complex detail to showcase the new processing power of the PlayStation 4. Opting to create a console exclusive game, Miyazaki drew 
    inspiration from the novel Dracula and transposed its bleak, Transylvanian scenery into the game. Of course, there are other parallels 
    to Gothic fiction in Bloodborne, too, like the game's focus on mysterious storytelling as opposed to lore-centric world building.</p>  
            
    <h2 style="background-color: rgba(133, 127, 127, 0.685);"> Parallel to Czech republic </h2>
    <p>Many of the locations in Bloodborne take inspiration from <b style="color: rgba(190, 45, 45, 0.616);">Romanian landmarks.</b>This is no surprise given Miyazaki's fondness for Dracula.
      Cainhurst Castle, for example, bears a striking resemblance to Bran Castle in Romania. Bran Castle is a popular tourist destination and
      is thought to be the inspiration for Dracula's Castle, which is in turn the inspiration for a collection of vampire video games. Moreover,
      the player actually approaches Cainhurst in a manner almost identical to Jonathan Harker (Dracula's protagonist), as both are transported 
      by a rickety horse-drawn carriage.

      The Grand Cathedral within the Cathedral Ward is another area that might have taken cues from real world Romania. This area in the game,
      patrolled by Vicar Amelia, bears many similarities to the Banat region's Timisoara Orthodox Cathedral. While the scale of the two may be
      disproportionate, the Grand Cathedral's open interior and marble floors match those of Tisoara's. Alternatively, the pillars that line the 
      border of the Grand Cathedral resemble those found within Catedrala Sfantul Gheorghe (St. George's Cathedral, also located in Timisoara, Romania).</p>
            
     <p>Players may have been preoccupied fighting the Cleric Beast, but the stone statues that line the Great Bridge mirror those found along the Charles Bridge in Prague.
      Prague's Lesser Town is comprised of various winding roads and subtle alleyways which, if filled with abandoned carriages and dense fog, look a lot like Central Yharnam.
      Then, of course, there's the Astral Clocktower and Prague's real life Astronomical Clock, which may just be the most compelling argument for the Czech city's influence in Bloodborne.</p>
                   
    <h2 style="background-color: rgba(133, 127, 127, 0.685);"> Other possible nods</h2>

  <p>  Thus far, these comparisons have focused on the places the FromSoftware team confirmed they visited. Throughout Bloodborne, however, even more real world influences are noticeable.
    In Central Yharnham, there's a certain water pump that looks like the one at the epicenter of 
    <a target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1854_Broad_Street_cholera_outbreak">
      <span style="color: rgba(190, 45, 45, 0.616);">London's Cholera outbreak in 1854.</span></a>

  <p>Players have pointed out the parallels between Yahar'gul Chapeland
     <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre-Dame_de_Paris">
      <span style="color: rgba(190, 45, 45, 0.616);">Notre Dame,</span></a>too, particularly its exterior.</p>

    <p> In Old Yharnham, the ruined church where players encounter the Blood-Starved Beast looks like the
      <a target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbey_of_San_Galgano">
        <span style="color: rgba(190, 45, 45, 0.616);"> Abbey of San Galgano in Italy.</a></p> 

    <p> Even smaller details in the game have real world counterparts: the suspended bridge to the right of the Upper Ward's
     main building bears an uncanny resemblance to the
     <a target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rialto_Bridge">
      <span style="color: rgba(190, 45, 45, 0.616);"> Realto Bridge in Venice,</span></a>for example.</p>

    <p> <b style="color: rgba(16, 80, 133, 0.671);">Note: Click the arrow 10x,</b>There are two kinds of weapons; handheld melee weapons, most of which have two forms that can be switched
      to on the fly - and more long range projectile weapons, like shotguns and pistols.
      Trick weapons have 3 variants - Normal, Uncanny and Lost. The difference between each variant is the location
       they are found and the Gem Imprints they come with (which dictates which gems can be slotted in them).</p>

    <p>
        key feature in Bloodborne is its combat. What differs this game from its predecessor, Demon Souls,
        <b style="color: rgba(185, 27, 27, 0.493);">is its speed</b>.
        Fighting enemies is more fast paced in Bloodborne than it is in any of the other Souls game. One
        thing Bloodborne adds to the combat aside from speed is a new kind of weapon, one that can change mid-battle,
        that can affect the way you use it and the way it effects enemies. These tools are called Trick Weapons. Trick
        Weapons vary in design, and usually rely on stats like Strength, Skill, and sometimes Arcane. Click on a weapon
        below to learn more about it.</p>

      <p><a target="_blank" href="https://bloodborne.fandom.com/wiki/Saw_Cleaver">
        <span style="color: rgba(133, 15, 15, 0.678);">Saw cleaver</span></a>
        One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used in the hunting business.
        This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts, transforms into a long cleaver that makes use of centrifugal force.
        The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness the more grotesquely transformed the beast.</p>

        <p><a target="blank" href="https://bloodborne.fandom.com/wiki/Threaded_Cane"></a><span style="color: rgba(133, 15, 15, 0.678);">Threaded cane</span></a>
          One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used by hunters on their duties.
          Sufficiently deadly as a rigid bladed cane, but also serves as a whip when its blade is split into many.
          Concealing the weapon inside the cane and flogging the beasts with the whip is partly an act of ceremony,
           an attempt to demonstrate to oneself that the bloodlust of the hunt will never encroach upon their soul.</p>

          <p><a target="blank" href="https://bloodborne.fandom.com/wiki/Hunter_Axe"><span style="color: rgba(133, 15, 15, 0.678);">Hunter axe</span></a>
            One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used on the hunt.
            Retains the qualities of an axe, but offers a wider palette of attacks by transforming. Boasts a heavy blunt attack, leading to high rally potential.
            No matter their pasts, beasts are no more than beasts. Some choose this axe to play the part of executioner.</p>

          <p><a target="_blank" href="https://bloodborne.fandom.com/wiki/Logarius%27_Wheel">
            <span style="color: rgba(133, 15, 15, 0.678);">Logarious wheel</span></a>
            Weapon wielded by martyr Logarius' band of executioners.
            Used to slaughter the Vilebloods in Cainhurst. Bathed in pools of their blood, and forever steeped in their ire.
            Transform to release the power of the wheel and manifest their lingering rage in a show of utter brilliance.</p>

          <p><a target="_blank" href="https://bloodborne.fandom.com/wiki/Church_Pick">
            <span style="color: rgba(133, 15, 15, 0.678);"> Church pick</span></a>
            One of the old trick weapons of the Healing Church, a hunting weapon formed from one of the giant picks that appear in old beast tales.
            The Church Pick initially serves as a long sword, but when transformed functions as an extended war pick.
            In spite of its origins, it is a highly practical weapon.</p>    
          

          <p><a target="_blank" href="https://bloodborne.fandom.com/wiki/Whirligig_Saw">
            <span style="color: rgba(133, 15, 15, 0.678);">Whirligig saw</span></a>
            A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs, and weapon of choice of the Old Hunter Valtr, the Beast Eater.
            This weapon pummels beasts in its mace form, but its true strength lies in its attached mechanical saws.
            These discs, lined with serrated teeth,spin rapidly, thrashing the flesh of beasts into fine shreds.</p> 
            
          <p><a target="_blank" href="https://bloodborne.fandom.com/wiki/Rakuyo">
              <span style="color: rgba(133, 15, 15, 0.678);">Rakuyo</span></a>
              Hunter weapon wielded by Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower.
              A trick sword originated in the same country as the Cainhurst Chikage, only this sword feeds not off blood, but instead demands great dexterity.
              Lady Maria was fond of this aspect of the Rakuyo, as she frowned upon blood blades, despite being a distant relative of the queen.
              One day she abandoned her beloved Rakuyo, casting it into a dark well, when she could stomach it no longer.</p>     
    
          <p><a target="_blank" href="https://bloodborne.fandom.com/wiki/Blade_of_Mercy">
            <span style="color: rgba(133, 15, 15, 0.678);">Blade of mercy</span></a>
            A special trick weapon passed down among hunters of hunters. One of the oldest weapons of the workshop.
            Splits into two when activated. The weapon's warped blades are forged with siderite, a rare mineral of the heavens.
            Most effective in swift attacks, such as after a quick-stepping.</p>     

          <p><a target="_blank" href="https://bloodborne.fandom.com/wiki/Holy_Moonlight_Sword">
          <span style="color: rgba(133, 15, 15, 0.678);">Holy moonlight sword</span></a>
            An arcane sword discovered long ago by Ludwig. When blue moonlight dances around the sword,
            and it channels the abyssal cosmos, its great blade will hurl a shadowy lightwave.The Holy Moonlight Sword is
            synonymous with Ludwig, the Holy Blade, but few have ever set eyes on the great blade, and whatever guidance it
            has to offer, it seems to be of a very private, elusive sort.</p>     

          <p><a target="_blank" href="https://bloodborne.fandom.com/wiki/Bloodletter">
          <span style="color: rgba(133, 15, 15, 0.678);">Bloodletter</span></a>
          The demented hunter weapon brandished by Brador, the Healing Church assassin.The Bloodletter assumes
         its true and terrifying form after it draws upon blood from the inner reaches of one's body and soul.
        This is the only effective means of expelling gained blood, or so Brador, isolated in his cell, continued to believe.</p>
